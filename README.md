## Abstract:
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This study proposes a full stack heart disease prediction system using machine learning algorithms. The system collects patient data, preprocesses and normalizes it, trains a machine learning model, and provides a prediction of the likelihood of heart disease. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in predicting heart disease with high accuracy. This system has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.

Keywords: Heart Disease Prediction, Machine Learning, Full Stack Development, Healthcare, Predictive Analytics.
